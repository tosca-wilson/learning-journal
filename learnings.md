Started the Complete Javascript Course on Udemy. Time logged = 1hr

Course starts at JS for beginners so is covering information I have already learned. It is interesting to go over the basic material again now that I am so familiar with it, and to reflect on how far I have come in such a short amount of time.

Today's section of the course was almost entirely revision from bootcamp material, but I found value in new learnings about JS operator precedence, which I had previously only know about vaguely.
